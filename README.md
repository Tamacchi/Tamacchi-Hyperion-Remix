# Tamacchi Modified Hyperion Case and Lupinix PCB for SlimeVR

## Use caution for USB C Aux ports. The IMUs are not 5V compatible and will damage IMUs if plugged into other devices.

### Electronics
Uses 4-pin USB C Breakout Board for Aux. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005187670446.html

Requires you to manually wire 4 cables from the AUX pins to a USB C breakout board.

Requires you to clip the sides of the USB C breakout board to fit into the printed notches. Then, add 3M tape on the empty spaces above the breakout board on the main case to minimize movement.

The TP4056 and Aux Case side of the USB C breakout board should be soldered directly onto the board without header pins.

### 3D Printing
The Forward Tray version pushes the TP4056's USB C port forward more, making it look neater and sit nicely in the printed USB C port hole.

Dual Color Printing stl files have a small 0.03mm indent on the top of the lid for the symbols and text. This allows you to separate them from the rest of the lid while printing everything on  the first layer when coloring in using Bambu Lab's color fill feature. 

Please rotate lid files with the top of the lid facing down on the bed before printing.
