Uses 4-pin USB C Breakout Board for Aux. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005187670446.html

Requires you to manually wire 4 cables from the AUX pins to a USB C breakout board.

Requires you to clip the sides of the USB C breakout board to fit into the printed notches. Then, add 3M tape on the empty spaces above the breakout board on the main case to minimize movement.

The TP4056 and Aux Case side of the USB C breakout board should be soldered directly onto the board without header pins.

The Forward Tray version pushes the TP4056's USB C port forward more, making it look neater and sit nicely in the printed USB C port hole.
